We'll show how to use our code in the same order of our presentation. 

part 1:
test 1: 
Run the rank_analysis.py file the results will be stored in the rank_figs folder. 
test 2:
In the python notebook clustering.ipynb you can find all the code used to generate the clusteringdistancematrix.png 

Part 2:
test 1:
for the results of the gdp growth/index analysis run the gdo_growth_analysis.py en gdp_index_analysis.py files. After running both files you'll find the result in the gdp_growth_figs and gdp_index_figs folders

test 2:
All heatmaps are generated in clustering.ipynb the results are stored in the heatmaps folder
